Data Source: https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/ 

These Community Mobility Reports aim to provide insights into what has changed in response to policies aimed at combating COVID-19. The reports chart movement trends over time by geography, across different categories of places such as retail and recreation, groceries and pharmacies, parks, transit stations, workplaces, and residential.

The Community Mobility Reports were developed to be helpful while adhering to our stringent privacy protocols and protecting people’s privacy. No personally identifiable information, such as an individual’s location, contacts or movement, will be made available at any point.


Hypothesis -- 
things have slowed down because pandemic. However, food and medicine visits are not as impacted by the pandemic. Also parks not as impacted by pandemic. We also have over a year of data so we can look at historical data. 

Clean data plan:
Merge -> drop columns -> print to csv

Analysis: 
historical data analysis -- YoY. compare different kinds of places. state by state breakdown. 

Clean and merge data -- figure out what's going on with the NaN stuff. drop columns that dont matter.
